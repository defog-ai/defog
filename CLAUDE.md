# Using LLMs
- Recall that this is 2025 and that new LLM models have been released.
  - Claude 4 Sonnet and Claude 4 Opus are now valid models
  - OpenAI's gpt-4.1, o3, and o4-mini are now valid models
  - Gemini's 2.5 flash and 2.5 pro are now valid models

# Testing
- Remember to run all tests with `python3.12 -m pytest ...`. This is to ensure you are using the correct version of python and pytest
- Add `PYTHONPATH=.` when running tests, so that the tests/examples use the version of defog in this repo - instead of the machine installed version
